the application has a user registry, it works as follows. There are system users and these have roles, the roles can be Admin or Client, where an administrator can add roles, delete roles, delete gateways, add devices to these etc, while a user with a client role can only see the gateways and the devices associated with them. Security JWT.

the app address is as follows on github ---- https://github.com/ajpirez/musala-test

inside the application you will find you should do the following execute in case of linux

sudo ./create_replic.sh --fork  

or equivalent on windows then 

mongo --port 27018 < init_replic.js

to lift the replicas of mongoDB since it implements transactions in the test for greater security.

You can also find a Dockerfile and another docker-compose file which generates the api with the replicas and the initial configuration of mongo to run our server application in docker

docker-compose up --build

I have developed a very basic application in react for this test in git is the code and you can also access it in a heroku where you make your deployment.

You can access the api documentation from heroku at this route

This is the swagger documentation

In the application inside the backend-section there is a test folder in which to implement unit tests with jest to the repositories and services.

I hope you like it
